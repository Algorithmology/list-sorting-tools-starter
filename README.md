## 🏁 Introduction

The following two modules for the course have covered algorithmic problem
solving strategies that support searching through and sorting data sets:

- [Dynamic Programming: Explore and innovative algorithmic paradigm](https://algorithmology.org/schedule/weekten/) 
- [Sorting Algorithms: Learn how to efficiently process data](https://algorithmology.org/schedule/weekeleven/)

This algorithm all-hands assignment invites you to apply what you learned in
those modules by implementing a benchmarking framework that operates in the
following fashion:

- Accept as input one or more Python source code files that contain one or more
functions that perform sorting. For the purposes of creating your benchmarking
framework you can assume that all sorting algorithms will implement the same
function signature that you carefully document in a README and your tool's
comments.
- Accept as input the fully-qualified name of a sorting function that should be
subject to benchmarking.
- Accept as input the description of an input generation procedure that can
automatically generate data suitable for the purposes of conducting a doubling
experiment to evaluate the performance of the sorting algorithm.
- Automatically extract the sorting function from the provided Python source
code file(s) and then reflectively invoke the function to sort data that was
automatically generated.
- In a series of automatically completed benchmarking rounds, the tool should
conduct a doubling experiment by which it generates data sets of increasing size
and then uses them to evaluate the performance of the sorting algorithm.
- The tool should produce diagnostic data that shows the execution time for each
round of the doubling experiment, a computed version of the doubling ratio based
on the collected data, and a statement about the likely worst-case time
complexity suggested by the doubling ratio.
- Your tool must be implemented with the Python programming language and use the
Poetry system for managing dependencies and packaging.
- Your tool must provide a command-line interface implemented through the use of
Typer and offer command-line arguments that fully support its configuration.
- Your tool can leverage Python source code that you previously implemented as a
part of a course project as long as you carefully document the source of any
Python code segments.

As you work to build and evaluate this system in a team-based fashion, please
keep in mind the following considerations and tasks:

- Meet in your assigned groups to discuss how your team is going to design,
implement, test, and evaluate your benchmarking framework. Make sure that you
give your benchmarking framework a descriptive name that reflects its purpose.
- Discuss with your team members which GitHub repository you are going to use to
coordinate your work. As you make this decision, please bear in mind that the
final version of your framework will be transferred to the course's GitHub
organization and so that it may be considered for use in follow-on projects.
- Specify, design, and implement a benchmarking framework that supports the
experimental evaluation of any sorting algorithm function that you and your team
members agree your benchmarking framework should support.
- Collect a group of sorting algorithms and use them to conduct a series of
doubling experiments that experimentally evaluate their performance with the
ultimate goal of determining which algorithm is the fastest and characterizing
the likely time complexity of each algorithm.
- Write and publish on the course web site a blog post that explains (a) how you
designed and implemented your benchmarking framework, (b) the sorting algorithm
functions that you chose to use in your doubling experiments, (c) the runtime
results from your experimental study with the benchmarking framework that you
implemented and (d) the running time results from an analytical evaluation that
you independently conducted. Your blog post should clearly articulate (a)
whether or not the experimental and analytical results for your function are in
alignment with each other, (b) what is most likely to be the realistic runtime
and true running time of a sorting function, and (c) why you judge that your
function has this runtime and running time, (d) which sorting algorithm function
from among those selected by your team members is the fastest, and (e) why this
single implementation proved to be the fastest among all of the sorting
algorithms.
- Present your findings to the entire class during the following week of the
academic semester during the follow-on algorithm all-hands session.
- Please note that all of the work that you complete for this assignment should
be published to the course web site. Your team must create and contribute to a
pull request on the course web site's GitHub repository and ensure that your
work is reviewed, revised, and published in advance of the Friday class session
next week. Importantly, your implementation of the benchmarking framework and
the sorting algorithms should be available in one or more additional GitHub
repositories that are referenced in the blog post that you write.

It is important to point out that your repository for this project was created
from the GitHub repository template called
[list-sorting-tools-starter](https://github.com/Algorithmology/list-sorting-tools-starter);
you can check this repository for any updates to this project's documentation or
source code! Finally, the teams and their corresponding functions will be
assigned through an announcement in Discord; check there for more details!

## 🤝 Seeking Assistance

Even though the course instructor will have covered all of the concepts central
to this project before you start to work on it, please note that not every
detail needed to successfully complete the assignment will have been covered
during prior classroom sessions. This is by design as an important skill that
you must practice as an algorithm engineer is to search for and then understand
and ultimately apply the technical content found in additional resources.
