## üèÅ Introduction

The following two modules for the course have covered algorithmic problem
solving strategies that support searching through and sorting data sets:

- [Dynamic Programming: Explore and innovative algorithmic paradigm](https://algorithmology.org/schedule/weekten/) 
- [Sorting Algorithms: Learn how to efficiently process data](https://algorithmology.org/schedule/weekeleven/)

This algorithm all-hands assignment invites you to apply what you learned in
those modules to complete the following steps in a team-based fashion:

- Meet in your assigned groups to discuss your assigned function from the
mid-term examination.
- Share and present to the other members of your team the source code that you
implemented.
- Discuss with your team members the likely runtimes and running times of your
implementations.
- Specify, design, and implement a benchmarking framework that supports the
experimental evaluation of the functions that you and your team members
implemented as a part of the mid-term examination.
- Write and publish on the course web site a blog post that explains (a) the
runtime results from your experimental study with the benchmarking framework
that you implemented and (b) the running time results from an analytical
evaluation that you independently conducted. Your blog post should clearly
articulate (a) whether or not the experimental and analytical results for your
function are in alignment with each other, (b) what is most likely to be the
realistic runtime and true running time of your function, and (c) why you judge
that your function has this runtime and running time, (d) which function from
among those implemented by your team members is the fastest, and (e) why this
single implementation proved to be the fastest among all of the solutions.
- Present your findings to the entire class during the following week of the
academic semester during the follow-on algorithm all-hands session.
- Please note that all of the work that you complete for this assignment should
be published to the course web site. Your team must create and contribute to a
pull request on the course web site's GitHub repository and ensure that your
work is reviewed, revised, and published in advance of the Friday class session
next week.

It is important to point out that your repository for this project was created
from the GitHub repository template called
[list-sorting-tools-starter](https://github.com/Algorithmology/list-sorting-tools-starter);
you can check this repository for any updates to this project's documentation or
source code! Finally, the teams and their corresponding functions will be
assigned through an announcement in Discord; check there for more details!

## ü§ù Seeking Assistance

Even though the course instructor will have covered all of the concepts central
to this project before you start to work on it, please note that not every
detail needed to successfully complete the assignment will have been covered
during prior classroom sessions. This is by design as an important skill that
you must practice as an algorithm engineer is to search for and then understand
and ultimately apply the technical content found in additional resources.

## üìö Project Details

TODO: Please make sure that you complete and document the following steps:

- TODO: Sign your pledge in this file to indicate that you adhered to the Honor
Code while completing this assignment.

- TODO: Provide a reference to the GitHub repository that your team used to
store your implementation of the benchmarking framework.

- TODO: Add a reference to the blog post that you and your team members wrote.

- TODO: Write at least two sentences to explain the key role(s) that you played
in completing this team-based project.
